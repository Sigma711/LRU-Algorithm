#### LRU(Least Recently Used) Simulation

It was an final assignment of my Data Structure course in the third term of college, so I spent 5 minutes thinking and half an hour coding for the project with C++.

I chose LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm for the project, because I was learning Operating System by myself and touched this wonderful algorithm.
