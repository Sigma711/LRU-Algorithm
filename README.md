#### LRU (Least Recently Used) Simulation

It was an final assignment of my Data Structure course in the third term of college, so I spent five minutes thinking and half an hour coding for the project with C++17.

I chose LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm for the project, because I was learning Operating System by myself and touched this wonderful algorithm.

It was just a tiny project that could help me establish a sense of standardization.
